Hi, my name is Dana.
<br>
I am a cyber security student with a passion for discovering and building offensive and defensive tools. I also enjoy animating and creating web apps, and one day hope to work on satellites and securing global networks.
<br>
I created this blog to organize and archive my efforts in cyber security. Feel free to contact me at ddonahue at protonmail dot com with any questions, ideas, or collaborative endeavors.
