## In flight
Headed towards my future, unwittingly. <br>

## On the ground
I'd never been to South Dakota before. My family was here to visit an unassuming college in the small town of Madison - Dakota State University.
<br>
<br>
My brother had chosen this college for it's strength in cyber security. At the time, I was quite ignorant of the field. I was too busy lining up my ducks for medical school.
<br>
<br>
_Get into biology research at UCSD_
<br>
_Finish psychology degree_
<br>
_Take the MCAT at the end of this year_
<br>
_Complete Pathmaker Internship_
<br>
_Maintain 4.0_
<br>
_Begin working at senior care home_
<br>
<br>
I was quite prepared. I even had my application timeline refined by a friend starting residency.
<br>
<br>
So I toured the campus with an air of indifference, caring only about what my brother thought and refraining from forming any opinions of my own. After all, it was not the college _I'd_ be attending.
## Back home
By this time next year, I would be attending Dakota State University, majoring in cyber security, and already Security+ certified. My neat row of ducks abandoned.
<br>
<br>
_The difficulty of medicine is not in the knowledge required to master it, but in the pain of administering that knowledge._ After working at a senior care home, I realized that pain. There is a tight rope you must walk when in the medical field; you must balance caring about your patients and preventing yourself from caring so that when you go home, their suffering does not haunt your sleep.
<br>
<br>
I learned the hard way that I was unable to separate myself from the pain of other's, even for the greater good. And so I left, choosing to pursue a path that would allow me to help people without being drenched in their misery.
## A new campus
I have not been to Dakota State University since enrolling. With covid-19 raging through the U.S., the campus has remained unknown to me. If I ever visit again, I doubt it will look the same as it did when I was simply a tourist instead of a student.
